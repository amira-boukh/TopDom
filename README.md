# TopDom
TopDom is a software tool to ideintify Topological Domains, which are basic builiding blocks of genome structrue. TopDom is computationally very efficient. Using detecting optimal polygon algorithm, TopDom detect topological domains in a linear time. As well as, this tool requires only a single parameter, which enable user to use easily.
